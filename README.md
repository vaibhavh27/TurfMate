## Overview

Turf Mate is an Android application designed to streamline the process of searching, browsing, checking availability, and booking sports turfs. It aims to provide a centralized, user-friendly platform for sports enthusiasts while offering turf managers efficient tools for managing their facilities and bookings.

---

## Problem Statement

Finding and booking sports turfs in urban areas can be inefficient and fragmented. Users often rely on scattered information across social media or word-of-mouth, leading to frustration and missed opportunities. Existing systems sometimes suffer from:

*   Lack of a centralized platform for multiple turfs.
*   Slow data retrieval and lack of real-time availability updates.
*   Poor user interfaces and difficult navigation.
*   Inadequate communication channels between users and turf managers.
*   Limited search and filtering options.
*   Inefficient booking management tools for turf owners.

Turf Mate directly addresses these challenges by offering a comprehensive, real-time, and intuitive mobile solution.
